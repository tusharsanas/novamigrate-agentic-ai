# Output Schema – Agentic AI Migration Assessment

## Purpose

This document defines the **complete output contract** generated by the Agentic AI Migration Assessment system.  
All outputs are derived from application and database input parameters and are designed to be **explainable, deterministic, and enterprise-ready**.

---

## Standard Complexity Levels

All complexity-related outputs use the following four levels:

```text
Low
Medium
High
Very High
```

## 1. Application Disposition (6Rs)

### Description
Recommended migration strategy for the application.

### Allowed Values
- Rehost
- Replatform
- Refactor
- Rearchitect
- Retire
- Retain

### Output Format
```yaml
application_disposition: Replatform
---

```
## 2. Application Complexity

### Description
Indicates the intrinsic complexity of the application layer derived from architecture, middleware, integrations, and technology stack.

### Allowed Values
- Low
- Medium
- High
- Very High

### Output Format
```yaml
application_complexity: High

```
## 3. Database Complexity

### Description
Indicates the complexity of the database layer based on database type, size, availability configuration, and data growth.

### Allowed Values
- Low
- Medium
- High
- Very High

### Output Format
```yaml
database_complexity: Medium

```
## 4. Overall Application Complexity

### Description
Represents the combined complexity of application and database layers.  
The highest-risk component determines the final classification.

### Allowed Values
- Low
- Medium
- High
- Very High

### Output Format
```yaml
overall_application_complexity: High

```
## 5. T-Shirt Size

### Description
Simplified sizing classification derived directly from the overall application complexity.

### Allowed Values
- S
- M
- L
- XL

### Output Format
```yaml
t_shirt_size: L

```
## 6. Migration Effort Estimation

### Description
Estimated effort required to migrate a single application.

### Allowed Values
Numeric range expressed in person-months (PM).

### Output Format
```yaml
migration_effort_pm:
  min: 6
  max: 9

```
## 7. Migration Cost Estimation

### Description
Estimated migration cost calculated from migration effort and cost per person-month.

### Allowed Values
Currency-based numeric range.

### Output Format
```yaml
migration_cost:
  currency: INR
  estimated_cost_range:
    min: 1500000
    max: 2250000

```
## 8. Modernization Recommendations

### Description
AI-generated recommendations aimed at reducing technical debt and improving cloud readiness.  
This output is mandatory for every application.

### Allowed Values
List of free-text recommendations.

### Output Format
```yaml
modernization_recommendations:
  - Containerize application using Amazon EKS
  - Modernize database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL
